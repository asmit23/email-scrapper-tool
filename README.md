Email Scraper
Email Scraper is a simple Python tool that crawls a website, extracts URLs, and collects email addresses from the website's pages. It uses BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content and regular expressions for email pattern matching. This project aims to automate the process of scraping emails from a target website, useful for gathering contact details for legitimate purposes such as outreach or lead generation.
